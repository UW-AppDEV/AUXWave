Going to a party with music? It's likely someone's got their iPod plugged into the sound system, and you want to play some of your tunes. Instead of swapping the AUX cord you can use AUXWave to add a song off your device, and upload it to the "DJ". The DJ can accept all requests, or only select a few. All requests are placed into the DJ's playlist, which can be shuffled or looped by preference.
